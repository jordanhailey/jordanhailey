# Hey there, I'm Jordan! 👋🏽 
<sup>If you'd like to know a bit about my background, <a href="#about-me">jump straight to the fluff.</a></sup>

I'm an aspiring Front End / Full Stack Developer [who would love your help](#we-can-help-each-other)... I want to get my hands on some real projects, especially projects that are being built with the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) in mind. 

## Technologies I like to work with...
> (in order of preference)
- JavaScript (Vanilla, Svelte, Vue, React, Typescript)
- HTML & CSS
- Deno runtime
- Node runtime

### Technologies I've used in a workshop or tutorial, but need further guidance with...
- Docker
- Ruby (incl. Ruby on Rails)
- Python3
- Rust

### Things I'm learning in my spare time
- Running applications on cloud hosting platforms like AWS, GCP, and Heroku

## We can help each other
**...How?**

Send me issues in your OSS project(s) to dig into. I love learning, and contributing, and I especially enjoy good technical documentation - so I'll always over-explain my commits/PRs for any features I create/modify. 

If this sounds like a good deal, ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Halfro_American). If you think you'd like to offer me a job (you're awesome) you can do your due dilligence on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanhailey/) and send me a message there, or through a DM on Twitter.

**I'm Looking forward to working with you and giving back to the OSS community!**

## About me
### I am transitioning into software development
Ideally, I'd like to work with JavaScript, either on the front end or the back end. But always happy to learn more languages.

### I was a volunteer throughout my early twenties
It was the fastest pace environment I've ever lived and worked at; I was able to work on housing and office projects that impacted 40,000+ other volunteers in a 6 year span. Why is any of this relevant? I learned so many valuable qualities during that time, qualities that I believe make me more approachable and easy to work with. From my short time observing the tech community, I've noticed just how important positivity and inclusivity is. I believe the diversity in thinking and positive attitude I bring to my work will be a refreshing addition to any team I work with.

### I 💗 🇿🇦 music
I may be born and raised in little old Portland, Oregon, USA - but the rhythm of my heart seems to beat with South African Kwaito and Amapiano music (thanks to a lovely South African I married 😄). While some may prefer to study/work with low-fi music, I get into the zone when I code with lively music.

### I am learning 🇷🇺
I have been learning Russian for the past two years, и мой русский довольно грубый, но я придерживаюсь его!

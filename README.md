# Hey there, I'm Jordan! 👋🏽 

I'm an aspiring Front End / Full Stack Developer who wants to work on impactful open source projects, and perhaps you're a maintainer of such a project who could use some help? Let's help eachother and work together.

## Technologies I like to work with
- JavaScript (including TypeScript)
- HTML
- CSS
- Frameworks like Svelte, 11ty, Express, React, Next, and Vue
- Node and Deno backends

## We can help each other

Send me issues in your OSS project(s) to dig into. I love learning, and contributing, and I especially enjoy good technical documentation - so I'll always over-explain my commits/PRs for any features I create/modify. 

If this sounds like a good deal, ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Halfro_American). If you think you'd like to offer me a job (you're awesome) you can do your due dilligence on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanhailey/) and send me a message there, or through a DM on Twitter.

**I'm Looking forward to working with you and giving back to the OSS community!**

## About me
### I am transitioning into software development
Ideally, I'd like to work with JavaScript, either on the front end or the back end. But always happy to learn more languages.

### I was a volunteer throughout my early twenties
For nearly 6 years I was able to work on housing and office projects that impacted 40,000+ other volunteers. I learned so many valuable qualities during that time, qualities that I believe make me more approachable and easy to work with. From my short time observing the tech community, I've noticed just how important positivity and inclusivity is. I believe the diversity in thinking and positive attitude I bring to my work will be a refreshing addition to any team I work with.

### I 💗 🇿🇦 music
I may be born and raised in little old Portland, Oregon, USA - but the rhythm of my heart seems to beat with South African Kwaito and Amapiano music (thanks to a lovely South African I married 😄). While some may prefer to study/work with lo-fi music, I get into the zone when I code with lively music.

### I am learning 🇷🇺
I have been learning Russian for the past two years, и мой русский довольно грубый, но я придерживаюсь его!
